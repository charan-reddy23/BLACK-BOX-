Ever wondered how many consecutive subarrays of length at leastÂ kÂ exist in an array of lengthÂ n? 

Use this formula:(nâˆ’k+1)(nâˆ’k+2)/2

Why it works:
  (n - k + 1)Â gives the starting points for exact lengthÂ k.
  Adding lengthsÂ k,k+1,...,nk,k+1,...,ncounts all longer subarrays!

ğŸ”¢ Combinatorics made simple for code optimization!
